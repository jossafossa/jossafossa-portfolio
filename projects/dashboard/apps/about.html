    Hi, my name is Joost Hobma. I studied MBO media at Friesland College and now I'm studying  @ Hanze Groningen. In my free time I occasionally like to build simple  projects. All of which you can check out at my project page. This website is also custom built from the ground up. When making this website I promised myself not to use any libraries or scripts, so everything you see here is built by me :).

    I love to write clean  interfaces. Writing  &  is like a drug for me.
    
    Besides that I also learned how to work with . I've worked fulltime for about 2 years at Mediasoep and learned a lot about building easy to use .
